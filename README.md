This product was developed during COVID-19 to 
1. Screen a large number of people based on 3 parameters - Temperature, Pulse Rate and SpO2
2. The purpose was to create a funnel where a large number of people can be screened in a short time so that probably infected people could be provided with a better care
3. The system uses this device as an IoT based data collection unit
4. It stored the data on a backend server which can be then checked during the next screening

The hardware system was developed in C and the web application was developed in PHP. 

Though this system was deployed at 30+ locations, it could not be scaled up due to delay in approvals during COVID.
