<p class="h2 text-primary font-italic">"prevention is better than cure"</p>
<br><br>

<p class="font-weight-normal">
In the current COVID-19 pandemic that has severely impacted the economies across the world, there is a limitation in 
funds available for healthcare. 
Ko-Aaham introduces <span class="text-primary font-weight-bold font-italic">Permit Me</span> a screening device to monitor 3 most important early 
indicators of COVID-19 â€“ <span class="text-primary font-weight-bold font-italic">Pulse Rate</span>, <span class="text-primary font-weight-bold font-italic">SPO2</span> and <span class="text-primary font-weight-bold font-italic">Temperature</span>. 
</p>

<p class="font-weight-normal">
This captured data is combined with a unique identity provided using the mobile number of the user. This allows us to store this information on the cloud and retrieve it later for analysis in case of any person found suffering with COVID-19.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
Once temperature and SPO2 levels are captured this information is analysed by the device. 
If any of the parameters are out of range an immediate alert is sounded by <font color="orange">Permit Me</font> 
device and an email alert is sent to the administrator to warn about suspected case. 
Additionally the device will only unlock the door if all parameters are all in acceptable range.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
Setting up of <font color="orange">Permit Me</font> is very easy. 
It can be installed at an entrance and exit of society, office, factory etc. or any other location 
from where people entering and exiting office can be monitored. 
It only requires a power connection And should be installed in a Wi-Fi enabled area. 
</p>
